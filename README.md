# The React Quiz App

This app is an application created with React that quizzes users on their knowledge of React history, theory, and practice. It showcases the utility of the useReducer hook for managing many pieces of state that are closely intertwined. I built this application as a guided project for the Udemy course "The Ultimate React Course 2025: React, Next.js, Redux & More" taught by Jonas Schmedtmann.

In order to use the app, you can fork it, install the correct dependencies with 
``` bash
npm i
```
and then open a separate terminal to start the pseudo API server that holds the questions by using the terminal command '''npm start server'''. Once that server is running, you can run this app with the command '''npm run start'''
